To run the python code for plotting data points from the RPLiDar in ```matplotlib.pyplot``` follow these steps:

  - Follow the [Starting Up LiDar] (https://github.com/liapia99/TargetArm-Capstone/blob/Julia/Starting%20Up%20LiDar.md)
  - While everything is running, open a new terminal
  - Type ```cd python_test```
  - Type ```python3 python-t.py```

  - I made sure to install python3 before running this code.

This was the output I got:

The program is slow to run and replicate data points which is something I will work on in the next few weeks.
