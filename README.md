## Getting Started
We followed this tutorial in order to set up the Jetson Nano to be able to code using C : https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-write-a-c-c-program-for-nvidia-jetson-nano/ 

Here are the steps for easy access:

First open the NVIDIA Terminal


Creating and moving files into a folder:

```mkdir folder_name ```


```cd folder_name```



Creating a new C programming file:

``` gedit file_name.c ```

**Remember to always save the file!**

To view, compile and run the file:
